Noteworthy passages from NLP book:

21.4: Reference phenomena

Five types of referring expressions:
1) Indefinite noun phrases
	Indefinite reference introduces into the discource context entities that are new to the hearer. The most commen form is marked with the determiner _a_ or _an_.
	Examples:
		Ms. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a _beautiful goose_.
		He had gone round one day to bring her some walnuts.
		
2) Definite noun phrases
	Refers to an entity  that is identifiable to the hearer. An entity is identifiable to the hearer because it has been mentioned 
	previously in the text and thus is already represented.
	
	Example:
		If concerns a white stallion which I have sold to an officer. But the pedigree of _the white stallion_ was not fully established.
		
3) Pronouns
	Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as _she_ could.
	
	Pronouns usually (not always) refer to entities that were introduced no further than TWO SENTENCES BACK.
	John went to Bob's party, and parked next to a classic Ford Falcon.
	He went inside and talked to Bob for more than an hour.
	Bob told him that he recently got engaged.
	?? He also said that he bought _it_ yesterday.
	He also said that he bought the Falcon yesterday.
	
	By the time the last sentence is reached, the Falson no longer has the degree of salience required to allow for pronominal reference.
	
	CATAPHORA:
		Where pronouns are mentioned before their referrents are.
			Even before she saw it, Dorothy had been ... doing stuff.
	
	Bound pronouns:
		Every dancer brought _her_ left arm forward.
		
		Under the relevant reading, her does not refer to some woman in context, but instead behaves like a variable bound to the expression _every dancer_.
		
4) Demonstratives
	Demonstrative pronouns, like this and that, behave differently than definite pronouns like _it_. They can appear either alone or as determiners, like _this ingredient_ or _that spice_.
	This and that differ in lexical meaning: 
		This, the proximal demonstrative indicates literal or metaphorical closeness.
		That, the distal demonstrative indicates liter or metaphorical distance.
			
			I just bought a copy of <some book>. I had bought one five years ago. _That one_ had been very tattered, _this one_ was in great condition.
			
5) Names:
